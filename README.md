# PY01 - Introduction to Python Programming 

## Python fundamentals

Welcome to the first UCL Data Science Society Workshop of the year!!

In this workshop we will set you up with the tools that we will use for the rest of term and introduce you to ***variables***, ***data types*** and ***operators*** in Python.

These act as the foundations for developing more complicated and advanced workflows that you often see in Data Science and Sofware Development applications.
