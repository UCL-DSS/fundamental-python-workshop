    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first Data Science Society workshop on Python! The aim of these workshops will be to teach you enough Python so that you'll be able to use machine learning algorithms on various datasets for data analysis. We will be avoiding the more complex maths behind these algorithms leaning instead towards packages like Scikit Learn which already provide us with these algorithms. To begin with we will cover the very basics of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first term, it is expected that we will follow the following workshop outlines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Workshop 1: Python fundamentals](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/fundamental-python-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 2: Python Data structures](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/python-sequence-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 3: Python Logic](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/python-logic-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 4: Github](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/git-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 5: SQL](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/SQL_workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 6: Numpy](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/numpy-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 7: Pandas](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/pandas-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 8: Matplotlib](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/matplotlib-workshop)\n",
    "- [Workshop 9: Linear regression](https://github.com/UCL-DSS/linear-regression-workshop)\n",
    "- Workshop 10: TBC\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these workshops is therefore Python fundamentals, with the purpose to introduce you to some of the tools we will be working with over the next two terms and, if we have, to introduce some of the basics of Python and how it works.\n",

    "Throughout these workshops we will be using the Jupyter Notebook editor. In this editor code is run in code cells and text is run in markdown cells.

These cells don't actually run code but mainly serve as a means of allowing you to describe what your code is supposed to do, so that you can inform someone else or remind yourself of what your code is doing when you revisit it. These cells also allow for the formatting of equations when you place something in between two single dollar signs. For instance: $ E = mc^2 $. Doing so between two double dollar signs places the equation on a new line like so: \n",

    "In these workshops you will see much of a jupyter notebook taken up by markdown code telling you about what the next code cell is expected to do or what you should be inputting into that cell.

    "### Commenting \n",
    "Inside code cells you can write notes by using the `#` symbol. Putting it in front of a line of code means that code won't be run when running the cell. This is useful when you want to see what removing a line of code briefly without deleting the line entirely and having to rewrite it again. Additionally, the # symbol is used in commenting on your code so that another user, or yourself when you return to the code can figure out what that code does. It is good practice to leave comments in your code however they should be consise to avoid overcommenting that may make your code harder to read. If ever in doubt imagine that if you ever undercomment two kittens die and if you ever overcomment one kitten dies. Below is a code cell identical to the one above save for the fact the # symbol is in front of the line of code. If you run the code you will not see any output."

As can be seen each argument is printed with a space in between them.

    "Be aware that is often easy to make syntax errors when performing mathmatical operations. Sometimes this involves writing something to the effect of ````2x```` instead of ````2*x```` where the former would look for a variable defined as ````2x```` and the latter would multiply a variable ````x```` by $2$. In large calculations when using brackets it is very easy to make mistakes so be alert for potential mistakes. Clarity of code is important to help make it easier to read and spot mistakes. Often rather than having an entire calculation in one messy line of code its often best to split the calculation into several lines that are easier to read. \n",
